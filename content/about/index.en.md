Hello. I'm Daniel, and what you've just found is my personal website on computer games. I have a specific interest in older and less well-known games. My personal golden age of gaming is the mid-1990s to early 2000s, and my favourite platform is, and always was, the IBM PC. You might notice this focus in the selection of games I like to spend my time with, and therefore write about. Here's a little of what that could include: the heyday of point & click adventure games, the DOS shareware era, tediously clearing up conventional memory to get sound drivers to load, the multimedia boom and interactive movies, janky and overambitious early 3D games, magazine covermount CD-ROMs with game demos, and so on.

My personal preferences will also be reflected in the game genres I spend most of my time with. I always favoured games focussing on stories, characters, and interesting game worlds, so my favourite genres are adventures and role-playing games. I also enjoy many action titles, and have a particular fondness for racing games. There will be little content on strategy games. Although I enjoy them in theory, I'm frustratingly bad at them. There will be even less content on puzzle games, and an almost complete veil of silence over the existence of sports games.

I have a habit of wanting to see how a game series, the works of a designer, a development studio, or even an entire platform developed. For that reason, I enjoy going back to the beginning of such a set of games, playing them one by one, and researching each title as I go along. Wanting to keep track of those chronological gaming projects, and taking a few notes, was the initial motive for starting this site. As I'm typing in these notes regardless, it's not a big effort to put them online.

The site offers an overview of these projects, and articles are ordered chronologically by the game or event they're about. If you see mention of a topic's "historical date", it means the date a game was released on, or on which an event took place, not the date I wrote about it.

I also maintain my own little games database. Apart from original descriptions, short reviews, and screenshots, I also describe the narrative content of games using my own keyword system. While I plan to publish that data as well, I haven't decided how or where yet. As soon as I get there, I'll try to link a game's entry in the database from any article that mentions it.

This website's pages are served statically, the way the web is supposed to be. If you have any feedback or questions, you can contact me at `daniel(at)dirgames.com`.
