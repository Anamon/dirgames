IBM managed to keep their big entrance into the home computer market out of public rumours for an impressively long time. The first press mention that I could find of what would ultimately become the IBM Model 5150 Personal Computer, is in the June 8, 1981 issue of the bi-weekly *InfoWorld* magazine[^iw] (thank you to Jimmy Maher for referencing it[^da]), little more than two months before the official announcement on August 12. That's even more surprising considering how many other companies IBM partnered with to put the machine together. Those non-disclosure agreements, which famously caused headaches for some companies, such as Digital Research, apparently worked pretty well.

InfoWorld's "reliable internal source" at IBM supplied them with plenty of precise technical details about the upcoming machine. The specifications were compelling, but not breathtaking for the time – regardless of the machine itself, the much bigger story was IBM's anticipated entry into the home computing market, up to that point dominated by Apple, Commodore, and Tandy Radio-Shack. But IBM was an entirely different beast, employing more than 350,000 people and reporting a revenue exceeding 29 billion dollars in 1981[^ibm]. It was a mixture of excitement between the air of legitimacy this would give the field, and dread at what such an economical force might do to the rest of the young industry. A good indication for this apprehension is the title InfoWorld gave for their scoop: "IBM to Pounce on Micro Market". Not the words one would use if they were uncertain of whether it was going to be a big entrance.
